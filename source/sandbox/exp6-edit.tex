\item Main suggestion:  Cut content and make things inquiry-based
\item Just saying at the beginning something like ``This lab will be
	different.  We're expecting you to think about what steps to take,
	rather than just follow a recipe" has a big effect on the students'
	attitudes.

\subsection*{Warm up}
\subsubsection*{Meet the apparatus}
In this experiment, you'll attempt to understand torques and rotational
equilibrium using a model of the human arm.

Before we get into equations, take a moment to understand the equipment.  
	Fill in the blanks on the diagram below, from among the following choices:
	upper arm (humerus), elbow, forearm, hand, and biceps muscle.
\TODO{TODO -- Block out the labels in the picture of the apparatus,
	and replace with blanks --

\subsubsection*{Get your head in the game}

Before making use of the apparatus,
let's do a brief warm up problem concerning \emph{torque}.

\TODO{TODO -- Now include an unrelated warm up problem dealing with
	static torque.  Possibly take this from UMD open source tutorials,
	or from tutorial books.}

\TODO{Maybe include a section getting students acquainted with the
	torque equation we're attempting to verify (relating bicep force to the
	force on the hand).}

in this lab we're going to allow you much more freedom to
investigate the physics behind this situation on your own.

\section*{Introduction}

This lab will be different from the others you've done so far.
Rather than giving you explicit steps to follow,
we're providing you with a problem to investigate
and some hints on how to proceed.  
It will be something of a challenge to figure out how exactly to accomplish
each step, but this will be much more like doing science in the real world.

\subsection*{Procedure}
\TODO{Do we want them to measure upper arm force at all?
In the interests of time, likely not.}
We wish to investigate some of the forces involved with weight lifting.
Specifically, we'll examine the situation where you're holding a weight in your
hand, with your forearm being held horizontal.
We'll measure the forces experienced by both the biceps muscle
and the upper arm.

If you'd like, imagine yourself as a 
physical therapist or prostetic limb designer,
who wishes to combine physics with some 
general experimental design skills to determine 
some of the forces involved in lifting objects.

** Common sense warning about using reasonable values, 
making sure to keep everything but the thing you're measuring constant, etc.**

** Discussion about which variables are relevant.  Answer -- forces, distances,
angles. **

** Make sure to emphasize that we'll keep the forearm horizontal, 
to simplify things. **

\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf{\arabic*.}]

\item
Start by measuring the biceps force $B$ and the upper arm force $A$ 
for some fixed weight $H$ being held in the hand.

Then devise and carry out a procedure for measuring the forces $B$ and $A$ for
different weights $H$.  
\question{Make sure to explicitly write out the steps of the procedure.}
If you find you need to modify the procedure as you carry it out,
that's okay -- but be sure to change the written version to correctly
reflect the steps you really carried out.

After taking several measurements (you can choose a number which seems
reasonable), use your data to 
\question{extrapolate a relationship between the biceps
force $B$ and the weight $H$ in the hand.}
\question{Write a explicit formula for $B$ as a function of $H$.}
\emph{Hint:  In case this terminology is a bit unfamiliar, 
it might help to know that
$y(t) = \bparen{10\,\mathrm{m}} +\bparen{4.9\,\mathrm{m/s^2}}t^2$ 
is an example of an explicit formula 
for $y$ as a function of $t$ (for a certain physical situation).}
Make sure you specify the units of the quantities.

\item
Choose a new value for $H$ -- one that you haven't measured yet,
but that you are able to measure.  
Before you measure $B$, 
\question{use your model to predict the biceps force $B$ 
for this new value of $H$.}

** Ideally, first make a rough prediction of $B$ based only on neighboring data
points, but I probably won't add this due to time. **

Now use the apparatus to measure $B$ for this value of $H$.  
\question{How does it compare to the prediction from your model?  }
(Calculate the percent deviation.)
If the two values don't precisely agree, do
you think this is okay?  
\question{Do you think it tells us our model is wrong?}
Why or why not?

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection*{Varying model parameters}
\TODO{TODO: Expand this prompt}

each of the following parameters:

\subsubsection*{Extrapolate further}
The model you extrapolated from your data is a good description of the 
force $B$ on this apparatus for this setup.  But what if you change the
apparatus somehow?  For example, consider an apparatus which
is the same as yours, except the forearm bar is longer.
For the same value of the weight $H$ in the hand, 
would the corresponding biceps force $B$ change? 
In fact, it does: $B$ is larger for a larger value of $R$ 
(assuming all other parameters are left the same).
** Ideally ask them a question, to make sure they pay attention to this part.
**

In reality, you probably want a model of the biceps force that is valid 
beyond your specific apparatus.  
To do this, we'll try to determine the coefficients in your formula for 
$B(H)$ in terms of various parameters of your apparatus -- that is, in terms of
things you can actually measure!  
For example, one such parameter is the length of the forearm bar -- if you
change this parameter, the coefficients in the formular for $B(H)$ change.
\TODO{Subtelty -- three types of experimental parameters:  
	(1) independent/dependent variables, 
	(2) parameters which change model parameters, but not the form of the model
	(3) parameters which ``break'' the model 
		-- i.e., they change the form of the model.
	In this case, $r,R,\alpha,W$ are type (2), whereas the angle of the forearm
	to the horizontal is type (3).\\

	We might be able to get this across by giving them an extended worked
	example of another model -- for example, a simple static torque problem,
	like in the warm up.

\subsubsection*{Understanding model parameters}
%\TODO{In the interest of time, it probably makes more sense to replace the
%previous section with this one.}
\TODO{
Ideally we'd have enough time to guide the students in deriving this formula,
but this isn't out main goal for the lab.  Hopefully we'll still give them some
intuition for the formula.
}

In a previous step above,
you experimentally determined a formula for the biceps force $B$ as a function
of the weight $H$ in the hand.  
%This formula included some coefficients (with units!).
Now we'll compare this model to the one the theory predicts.

It turns out that we can analyze the torques acting on the forearm
to determine a formula for $B$ vs $H$.  You actually have all the tools needed
to do this from the warm up exercises at the beginning of this lab, and we
encourage you to give it a try!  But in the interest of time, we'll just
provide you with the formula, which is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	B = \paren{ H + \frac{W}{2} }\frac{R}{r\cos\alpha}
\end{equation*}

Given this theoretical model, 
can you determine what the theory predicts the coefficients appearing in
your formula for $B$ vs $H$ should be?  
\question{First write your answer in terms of symbols} 
(i.e., variables) only;
\question{then, plug in the values for those variables} from your apparatus, 
to determine the theoretical model coefficients.
How do these theoretical coefficients compare to your experimental model
coefficients?  
(\question{Calculate the percent difference} 
and \question{comment on how well they agree}.)

You just used a theoretical model to predict the values of your experimental
model coefficients.
Now, we'll look at the predictions the theoretical model makes on your data
itself.  
(This may seem similar to the previous step,
but there's actually a subtle difference.)
Hopefully, you noticed your data plot of $B$ vs $H$ was linear.
It turns out, we can use the theoretical model to predict what the slope and
$y$-intercept of that graph should be.
First, use the theoretical model to 
\question{predict the slope and $y$-intercept 
of your graph in terms of symbols only.}
Next, \question{plug in the actual parameter values 
from your experimental apparatus}
to get a numerical value for these parameters (with units!).
\question{How does this prediction compare 
with your actual slope and $y$-intercept?}

\TODO{Probably want to avoid making them do the same steps twice...}

\question{Do the theoretical predictions above agree 
with the predictions you recorded in the chart above},
regarding how the bicep force and linear equation parameters change when
increasing certain apparatus parameters?

You probably noticed some similarities between the previous steps.
Why do they seem so similar?  
Is there a relationship between the model parameters
and the slope and $y$-intercept of your graph?
\answer{Since this is a linear model, the model parameters are precisely
	the slope and the $y$-intercept of the graph.}
