\section*{Introduction}

\TODOshanna{
	Recommend emailing students in advance to get them excited. :)
	Add something like ``Because it generally takes longer to devise your own
	steps, you will notice this lab has significantly fewer parts.''
}
	

This lab will be different from the others you've done so far.
First, we'll have some warm-up exercises to familiarize yourself 
with some of the theory, as well as the experimental setup.
Then you'll move on to the experiment itself.

Rather than giving you explicit steps to follow at every stage,
at times we'll provide you with a problem to investigate
and some hints on how to proceed.  
It will be something of a challenge to figure out how exactly to accomplish
each step, but this will be much more like doing science in the real world.
We hope you enjoy the process!

\section*{Procedure}
Every time a person lifts a weight, throws a ball, or turns a page,
there are forces involved throughout the muscular and skelatal systems.
We wish to investigate just one example of those forces.
%We wish to investigate some of the forces involved with weight lifting.
Specifically, we'll examine the situation where you're holding a weight in your
hand, with your forearm being held horizontal.
We'll measure the forces exerted by the biceps muscle.

If you'd like, imagine yourself as a 
physical therapist or prosthetic limb designer,
who wishes to combine physics with some 
general experimental design skills to determine 
some of the forces involved in lifting objects.


As we said before, you'll be given quite a bit more freedom in this lab.
Part of that means you'll have to think critically about 
which steps you'll be taking, and you'll have to examine your results to 
check whether they seem reasonable.  
When you're making decisions like this, think back to some of the things
you've done in the previous labs -- many of those choices were made 
for good reasons, and represent good experimental practices.

\begin{enumerate}[series=labproc,label={\bf \arabic*.}]

\item
{\bf In everything that follows, make sure the forearm bar is horizontal.}
We're focusing on this case 
(1) because every experiment needs to focus on specific scenarios in order to 
make meaningful conclusions,
and (2) because keeping the forearm horizontal vastly simplifies both the
measurements and the calculations.

\item
\question{Start by measuring the biceps force $B$ 
for some fixed weight $H$ being held in the hand.}
Make sure to record this value (with units).
Note that the force gauges are labelled with units of mass (kilograms) rather
than units of force (Newtons).  
You need to multiply the mass readings by $g=\smans{9.8}{m/s^2}$ 
to convert the mass values to
their corresponding \emph{weight} values.  Note that you may wish to first just
record the mass values, and convert to weight using Excell.
\eq{
	B = \bparen{\text{Biceps gauge reading (in kilograms)}}\times g
}

\item
Now devise and carry out a procedure for measuring (and recording)
the force $B$ for different weights $H$.  
\question{Make sure to explicitly write out the steps of the procedure.}
If you find you need to modify the procedure as you carry it out,
that's okay -- but be sure to change the written version to correctly
reflect the steps you really carried out.

\item
After taking several measurements (you can choose a number which seems
reasonable), use your data to 
\question{extrapolate a relationship between the biceps
force $B$ and the weight $H$ in the hand}:
First, argue that your data shows a linear relationship between $B$ and $H$.
\question{Then, write an explicit formula for $B$ as a function of $H$.}
\emph{Hint:  In case this terminology is a bit unfamiliar, 
it might help to know that
$y(t) = \bparen{10\,\mathrm{m}} +\bparen{4.9\,\mathrm{m/s^2}}t^2$ 
is an example of an explicit formula 
for $y$ as a function of $t$ (for a certain physical situation).}
Make sure you specify the units of all quantities involved.
Hint:  You've performed similar steps in previous labs.
Think back to any time you graphed your data 
and fit a trendline to the graph.

\answer{The idea is that they need to realize to make a graph to do this.
	Then they need to notice that the graph is linear,
	so the `formula' is just the equation of a line.
}

\item
Choose a new value for $H$ -- one that you haven't measured yet,
but that you are able to measure.  
Before you measure $B$, 
\question{use your model to predict the biceps force $B$ 
for this new value of $H$.}
\TODOshanna{``Before you make the measurement, 
have your TA approve your prediction and reasoning.''}

\item
Now use the apparatus to measure $B$ for this value of $H$.  
\question{How does it compare to the prediction from your model?  }
(Calculate the percent deviation.)
If the two values don't exactly agree, do
you think this is okay?  
\question{Do you think it tells us our model is wrong?}
Why or why not?

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection*{Varying model parameters}
\TODO{TODO: Expand this prompt.  Clarify that they won't be doing an experiment
for this, and explain why predictions are important.}

Now that you've gained a bit of familiarity with the apparatus
by taking some measurements, 
let's take a step back and think a bit more about what's going on.

\begin{enumerate}[labproc]
\item
Using a combination of your intuition for how your own arm works,
and the knowledge of torque you developed in the warm up exercises,
\question{predict how the biceps force change when we increase 
each of the following parameters. }
Fill in your own copy of the chart below, 
answering with ``increases'', ``decreases'', 
``stays constant'', or ``something else''.  
(If you choose something else, explain why you chose that.)
\vspace{.5cm}
\\
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Parameter change & Effect on $B$ 
	& Effect on value of $B$ when $H=0$
	& Effect on $\Delta B/\Delta H$ 
	\\ \hline \hline
	$\uparrow R$ 
	& & & 
	\\ \hline
	$\uparrow r$ 
	& & & \\ \hline
	$\uparrow W$ 
%	& & & \\ \hline
%	$\uparrow \alpha$
	& & & 
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}\\

\question{How do (a) the value of $B$ when $H=0$ 
and (b) $\Delta B/\Delta H$ 
relate to the slope and vertical intercept of your graph?}

\item
The way our apparatus is set up, 
the easiest of the above parameters to vary experimentally is $r$.
Devise an experiment to 
\question{determine the effect that increasing $r$
has on the biceps force $B$ as well as 
on the slope and the \yint  of the graph.}
Make sure to record the data that leads you to this conclusion.
Do your results agree with your prediction above?

\answer{They should choose a new value for $r$, then re-enact their procedure
	to determine $B(H)$ for this new $r$ value.  
	{\bf It might be difficult for them
	to realize that they don't want to find $B(r)$ }
	-- doing so does answer the first question, 
	but it doesn't tell them anything about the slope or the \yint.}

\answer{
	Subtlety: 
	Changing $r$ changes $\alpha$ as well.  
	It might be worth TAs mentioning this to students, 
	but note that it shouldn't really affect their answers much,
	at least for the values of $r$ allowed by the apparatus.
}

\end{enumerate}



\begin{comment}
%% Section talking somewhat abstractly about models and asking for predictions.
	%% Likely difficult for students to comprehend, and likely will take too
	%% given the time constraints.
{{{
\subsubsection*{Extrapolate further}
The model you extrapolated from your data is a good description of the 
force $B$ on this apparatus for this setup.  But what if you change the
apparatus somehow?  For example, consider an apparatus which
is the same as yours, except the forearm bar is longer.
For the same value of the weight $H$ in the hand, 
would the corresponding biceps force $B$ change? 
In fact, it does: $B$ is larger for a larger value of $R$ 
(assuming all other parameters are left the same).
\TODO{Ideally ask them a question, to make sure they pay attention to
this part.}

In reality, you probably want a model of the biceps force that is valid 
beyond your specific apparatus.  
To do this, we'll try to determine the coefficients in your formula for 
$B(H)$ in terms of various parameters of your apparatus -- that is, in terms of
things you can actually measure!  
For example, one such parameter is the length of the forearm bar -- if you
change this parameter, the coefficients in the formular for $B(H)$ change.
\TODO{Subtelty -- three types of experimental parameters:  
	(1) independent/dependent variables, 
	(2) parameters which change model parameters, but not the form of the model
	(3) parameters which ``break'' the model 
		-- i.e., they change the form of the model.
	In this case, $r,R,\alpha,W$ are type (2), whereas the angle of the forearm
	to the horizontal is type (3).\\

	We might be able to get this across by giving them an extended worked
	example of another model -- for example, a simple static torque problem,
	like in the warm up.
}
}}}
\end{comment}

%\subsubsection*{Understanding model parameters}
\subsubsection*{Comparing results to theoretical predictions}
\TODO{
Ideally we'd have enough time to guide the students in deriving this formula,
but this isn't out main goal for the lab.  Hopefully we'll still give them some
intuition for the formula.
}

In a previous step above,
you experimentally determined a formula for the biceps force $B$ as a function
of the weight $H$ in the hand.  
Now we'll compare this model to the one the theory predicts.

It turns out that we can analyze the torques acting on the forearm
to determine a formula for $B$ vs $H$.  You actually have all the tools needed
to do this from the warm up exercises at the beginning of this lab, and we
encourage you to give it a try!  But in the interest of time, we'll just
provide you with the formula, which is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	B = \paren{ H + \frac{W}{2} }\frac{R}{r\cos\alpha}
\end{equation*}


\begin{enumerate}[labproc]

\item
%Hopefully, you noticed your data plot of $B$ vs $H$ was linear.
Now that we have this theoretical model, 
we can use it to predict what the slope and \yint of your graph should be.
First, use the theoretical model to 
\question{predict the slope and \yint  
of your graph in terms of symbols} (i.e., variables) only.
Next, \question{plug in the actual parameter values 
that correspond to your experimental apparatus}
to get a numerical value for these theoretical coefficients (with units!).
\question{How does this prediction compare 
with your actual slope and \yint ?}

\question{Do the theoretical predictions above agree 
with the predictions you recorded in the chart above},
regarding how the biceps force and linear equation parameters change when
increasing certain apparatus parameters?

\end{enumerate}


\temp{\pagebreak}
\section*{Wrapping up}
\begin{enumerate}[labproc]
	\item 
		Note:  This problem involves quite a bit of reading,
		but it should help you understand the importance of a key
		concept, which will help you on your homework and exams.

%		Imagine that you suspected the biceps force gauge on
%		your apparatus were malfunctioning.
%		The gauge currently reads 2 kilograms,
%		and you want to check whether that value makes sense.
		Imagine you and a friend wanted to predict the biceps force by 
		directly analyzing the torques involve in the apparatus.
		You and your friend determine that the experimental parameters for
		your apparatus are 
%		{$R,r,W,H=...$.  ]}.
		$R=\smans{40}{cm}$, $r=\smans{15}{cm}$,
		$W=\smans{100}{g}$, $H=\smans{200}{g}$.
		Your friend attempts to use the theoretical model
		to predict the value of the biceps force.
		He claims that the torque exerted by the biceps must be equal and 
		opposite to the torque exerted by the weight in the hand
		plus the weight of the arm itself, 
		which is equal to $H R + W R/2$, in the counter clockwise direction.
		Furthermore, your friend claims that the torque due to
		the biceps is $B r$, in the clockwise direction.
%		Thus, we must have $B=\paren{H+W/2}R/r$.
		Since the torques must be equal and opposite, we have
		$Br=HR+WR/2$.

		You read the biceps gauge and find it reads 2 kilograms.
		Solve the equation above for $B$, and 
		\question{plug in the values of your experimental parameters.
		Does the resulting value for $B$ agrees 
		with the measured biceps force.}

		If your prediction is not consistent with the experimental result, 
		go back and figure out what was wrong with your friend's argument
		above.  
%		Redo the calculation of the prediction correctly,
%		and verify that it agrees with your experimental result.

		Was there a key torque concept he forgot to take into account?
		\answer{Your friend forgot to consider the angle at which torque is
			applied.  Note:  I predict some students will try to replace $r$
		with $r/2$, since that's what it might look like is done for $W$.
		{\bf The key torque concept} your friend forgot was to consider 
		{\bf the angle at which the force is applied}.  
		}

\TODOmeeting{
\itemb
	\item Let them know this analysis will help them on the test.
\iteme
}
\TODO{Make sure the numerical values make sense.
		Make sure to have a large value of $r$, so $\cos\alpha$ is small.}

\TODOmeeting{New problem:  Difference between this model and the real world?}
\TODO{
	New problem:  
	Ask students to estimate the `experimental parameters' associated
	with their own arms.  Maybe ask how the force compares for someone with a
	shorter arm.
	\answer{$R,r,W$ all smaller, $H,\theta$ remain the same.
		Less torque due to bicep, but also less torque due to hand force
		and weight of arm.  
		If $r$ and $R$ decrease in proportion, it takes the smaller person
		slightly less biceps force to lift the same amount of weight.
