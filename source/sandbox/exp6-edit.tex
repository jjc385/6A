\section*{Introduction}

\TODOshanna{
	Recommend emailing students in advance to get them excited. :)
	Add something like ``Because it generally takes longer to devise your own
	steps, you will notice this lab has significantly fewer parts.''
}
	

This lab will be different from the others you've done so far.
First, we'll have some warm-up exercises to familiarize yourself 
with some of the theory, as well as the experimental setup.
Then you'll move on to the experiment itself.

Rather than giving you explicit steps to follow at every stage,
at times we'll provide you with a problem to investigate
and some hints on how to proceed.  
It will be something of a challenge to figure out how exactly to accomplish
each step, but this will be much more like doing science in the real world.
We hope you enjoy the process!

\section*{Procedure}
We wish to investigate some of the forces involved with weight lifting.
Specifically, we'll examine the situation where you're holding a weight in your
hand, with your forearm being held horizontal.
We'll measure the forces exerted by the biceps muscle.

If you'd like, imagine yourself as a 
physical therapist or prosthetic limb designer,
who wishes to combine physics with some 
general experimental design skills to determine 
some of the forces involved in lifting objects.

\TODO{TODO:  Common sense warning about using reasonable values, 
making sure to keep everything but the thing you're measuring constant, etc.}

%\TODO{ Discussion about which variables are relevant.  
%Answer -- forces, distances, angles. 
%Not sure whether to move this elsewhere}

\TODO{TODO: Make sure to emphasize that we'll keep the forearm horizontal, 
to simplify things.}

\question{Start by measuring the biceps force $B$ 
for some fixed weight $H$ being held in the hand.}
\TODOshanna{Tell them to record the values.}

Then devise and carry out a procedure for measuring the forces $B$ for
different weights $H$.  
\question{Make sure to explicitly write out the steps of the procedure.}
If you find you need to modify the procedure as you carry it out,
that's okay -- but be sure to change the written version to correctly
reflect the steps you really carried out.

After taking several measurements (you can choose a number which seems
reasonable), use your data to 
\question{extrapolate a relationship between the biceps
force $B$ and the weight $H$ in the hand.}
\TODOshanna[inline,fancyline]{Remind them ``You did this in the XX lab''}
\question{Write an explicit formula for $B$ as a function of $H$.}
\emph{Hint:  In case this terminology is a bit unfamiliar, 
it might help to know that
$y(t) = \bparen{10\,\mathrm{m}} +\bparen{4.9\,\mathrm{m/s^2}}t^2$ 
is an example of an explicit formula 
for $y$ as a function of $t$ (for a certain physical situation).}
Make sure you specify the units of the quantities.
\answer{The idea is that they need to realize to make a graph to do this.
	Then they need to notice that the graph is linear,
	so the `formula' is just the equation of a line.
}

Choose a new value for $H$ -- one that you haven't measured yet,
but that you are able to measure.  
Before you measure $B$, 
\question{use your model to predict the biceps force $B$ 
for this new value of $H$.}
\TODOshanna{``Before you make the measurement, 
have your TA approve your prediction and reasoning.''}

Now use the apparatus to measure $B$ for this value of $H$.  
\question{How does it compare to the prediction from your model?  }
(Calculate the percent deviation.)
If the two values don't exactly agree, do
you think this is okay?  
\question{Do you think it tells us our model is wrong?}
Why or why not?




\subsubsection*{Varying model parameters}

and the knowledge of torque you developed in the warm up exercises,
\question{predict how the biceps force change when we increase 
each of the following parameters. }

``stays constant'', or ``something else''.

%% Section talking somewhat abstractly about models and asking for predictions.

{{{
\subsubsection*{Extrapolate further}
The model you extrapolated from your data is a good description of the 
force $B$ on this apparatus for this setup.  But what if you change the
apparatus somehow?  For example, consider an apparatus which
is the same as yours, except the forearm bar is longer.
For the same value of the weight $H$ in the hand, 
would the corresponding biceps force $B$ change? 
In fact, it does: $B$ is larger for a larger value of $R$ 
(assuming all other parameters are left the same).
\TODO{Ideally ask them a question, to make sure they pay attention to
this part.}

In reality, you probably want a model of the biceps force that is valid 
beyond your specific apparatus.  
To do this, we'll try to determine the coefficients in your formula for 
$B(H)$ in terms of various parameters of your apparatus -- that is, in terms of
things you can actually measure!  
For example, one such parameter is the length of the forearm bar -- if you
change this parameter, the coefficients in the formular for $B(H)$ change.
\TODO{Subtelty -- three types of experimental parameters:  
	(1) independent/dependent variables, 
	(2) parameters which change model parameters, but not the form of the model
	(3) parameters which ``break'' the model 
		-- i.e., they change the form of the model.
	In this case, $r,R,\alpha,W$ are type (2), whereas the angle of the forearm
	to the horizontal is type (3).\\

	We might be able to get this across by giving them an extended worked
	example of another model -- for example, a simple static torque problem,
	like in the warm up.
}

\subsubsection*{Understanding model parameters}
\TODO{
Ideally we'd have enough time to guide the students in deriving this formula,
but this isn't out main goal for the lab.  Hopefully we'll still give them some
intuition for the formula.
}

In a previous step above,
you experimentally determined a formula for the biceps force $B$ as a function
of the weight $H$ in the hand.  
Now we'll compare this model to the one the theory predicts.

It turns out that we can analyze the torques acting on the forearm
to determine a formula for $B$ vs $H$.  You actually have all the tools needed
to do this from the warm up exercises at the beginning of this lab, and we
encourage you to give it a try!  But in the interest of time, we'll just
provide you with the formula, which is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	B = \paren{ H + \frac{W}{2} }\frac{R}{r\cos\alpha}
\end{equation*}

\begin{comment}
{{{
Given this theoretical model, 
can you determine what the theory predicts the coefficients appearing in
your formula for $B$ vs $H$ should be?  
Hopefully, you noticed your data plot of $B$ vs $H$ was linear.
It turns out, we can use the theoretical model to predict what the slope and
\yint  of that graph should be.
\question{First write your answer in terms of symbols} 
(i.e., variables) only;
\question{then, plug in the values for those variables} 
according to your apparatus, 
to determine the theoretical model coefficients.
How do these theoretical coefficients compare to your experimental model
coefficients?  
(\question{Calculate the percent difference} 
and \question{comment on how well they agree}.)

You just used a theoretical model to predict the values of your experimental
model coefficients.
Now, we'll look at the predictions the theoretical model makes on your data
itself.  
(This may seem similar to the previous step,
but there's actually a subtle difference.)

\section*{Wrapping up}
\itemb
	\item 
%		Imagine that you suspected the biceps force gauge on
%		your apparatus were malfunctioning.
%		The gauge currently reads 2 kilograms,
%		and you want to check whether that value makes sense.
		Imagine you and a friend wanted to predict the biceps force by 
		directly analyzing the torques involve in the apparatus.
		You and your friend determine that the experimental parameters for
		your apparatus are {$R,r,W,H=...$.  ]}.
		Your friend attempts to use the theoretical model
		to predict the value of the biceps force.
		He claims that the torque exerted by the biceps must be equal and 
		opposite to the torque exerted by the weight in the hand
		plus the weight of the arm itself, 
		which is equal to $H R + W R/2$, in the counter clockwise direction.
		Furthermore, your friend claims that the torque due to
		the biceps is $B r$, in the clockwise direction.
%		Thus, we must have $B=\paren{H+W/2}R/r$.
		Since the torques must be equal and opposite, we have
		$Br=HR+WR/2$.

		You read the biceps gauge and find it reads 2 kilograms.
		Solve the equation above for $B$, and 
		\question{plug in the values of your experimental parameters.
		Does the resulting value for $B$ agrees 
		with the measured biceps force.}

		If your prediction is not consistent with the experimental result, 
		go back and figure out what was wrong with your friend's argument
		above.  Redo the calculation of the prediction correctly,
		and verify that it agrees with your experimental result.

		Was there a key torque concept he forgot to take into account?
		\answer{Your friend forgot to consider the angle at which torque is
			applied.  Note:  I predict some students will try to replace $r$
		with $r/2$, since that's what it might look like is done for $W$.

		{\bf the angle at which the force is applied}.
