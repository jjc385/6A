\section*{Overhauled Bicep Lab}

\subsection*{Notes from Allic}
\enumb
\item Main suggestion:  Cut content and make things inquiry-based
\item Just saying at the beginning something like ``This lab will be
	different.  We're expecting you to think about what steps to take,
	rather than just follow a recipe" has a big effect on the students'
	attitudes.  
	[Jared is not surprised by this, though he hadn't thought of doing it.]

\subsection*{Warm-up}
\subsubsection*{Meet the apparatus}
In this experiment, you'll attempt to understand torques and rotational
equilibrium using a model of the human arm.

Before we get into equations, take a moment to understand the equipment.  
	Fill in the blanks on the diagram below, from among the following choices:
	upper arm (humerus), elbow, forearm, hand, and biceps muscle.
\todo[inline]{TODO -- Block out the labels in the picture of the apparatus,
	and replace with blanks -- 
	similar to a diagram one might fill in for a biology
	course.  Blanks include 
	upper arm (humerus), elbow, forearm, hand, and biceps muscle.}

\subsubsection*{Get your head in the game}

Before making use of the apparatus,
let's do a brief warm-up problem concerning \emph{torque}.

\todo[inline]{TODO -- Now include an unrelated warm-up problem dealing with
	static torque.  Possibly take this from UMD open source tutorials,
	or from tutorial books.}

\todo[inline]{Maybe include a section getting students acquainted with the
	torque equation we're attempting to verify (relating bicep force to the
	force on the hand).}

\subsection*{Investigation}

Rather than telling you exactly what to do, 
in this lab we're going to allow you much more freedom to
investigate the physics behind this situation on your own.
