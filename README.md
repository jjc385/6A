## Lab Manual Project

This repository is partitioned into three main folders:
source, output, and scripts.

* source -- Location of source files.  Mostly .tex files.
* output -- Location of pdf files output from compiling .tex files.  Ideally,
  the script to compile will output log and aux files here as well.
* scripts -- Location of bash scripts which compile the .tex files all at once.
