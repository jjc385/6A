# 6A
## Lab Manual Project

This repository is partitioned into several main folders:

* source -- Location of source files.  Mostly .tex files.
* imgs -- Location of images embedded in the lab manual.
* output -- Location of pdf files output from compiling .tex files.  Ideally,
  the script to compile will output log and aux files here as well.
* scripts -- Location of bash scripts which compile the .tex files all at once.
* handouts-6A -- Location of handouts, created by past TAs, 
explaining how to do the experiments more clearly than the manual.

### TODO list

* Clean up source/content/exp3 -- currently contains several tex files 
with nothing but modified mills sections (ostensibly to distribute to TAs)
